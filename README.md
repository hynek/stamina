Transient failures are common in distributed systems.
To make your systems resilient, you need to **retry** failed operations.
But bad retries can make things *much worse*.

*stamina* is an opinionated wrapper around the great-but-unopinionated [Tenacity](https://tenacity.readthedocs.io/) package.
Its goal is to be as **ergonomic** as possible while doing the **right thing by default** and minimizing the potential for **misuse**.
It is the result of years of copy-pasting the same configuration over and over again:

- Retry only on certain exceptions.
- Exponential **backoff** with **jitter** between retries.
- Limit the number of retries **and** total time.
- Automatic **async** support â€“ including [Trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/).
- Preserve **type hints** of the decorated callable.
- Flexible **instrumentation** with [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python), [*structlog*](https://www.structlog.org/), and standard library's `logging` support out-of-the-box.
- Easy _global_ deactivation for testing.

For example:

```python
import httpx

import stamina


@stamina.retry(on=httpx.HTTPError, attempts=3)
def do_it(code: int) -> httpx.Response:
    resp = httpx.get(f"https://httpbin.org/status/{code}")
    resp.raise_for_status()

    return resp
```

<!-- end docs index -->

**Async** callables work use the same API and it's possible to retry **arbitrary blocks**, too.
